## Lesson about Props:

Within the single file `App.js` adding the components and pass the property data to the component by using `Props concept` and then i call the button in the `index.js`.

### Notes:

In `Btndynamic` I call the component `Mybtn` on that i pass the property data.
In `Btndynamic` i added arithmetic Operations like addition, subraction, multiplication, divison and then i call the function by passing the props to `Mybtn`.
